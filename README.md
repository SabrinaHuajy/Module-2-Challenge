# SabrinaHuajy-Portfolio

A portfolio of work to showcase my skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. 

I am trying to construct an effective portfolio highlights my strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. According to the words of wisdom, Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp. This last point can’t be stressed enough: having several deployed projects is a minimum requirement to receive an initial interview at many companies, which is something I truly desire.

With these points in mind, in this Challenge I’ll set myself up for future success by applying the core skills I've recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. I'll get to practice my new skills while creating something that I will use during my job search. It’s a win-win that I'll likely be grateful for in the future!

I aim to fulfill the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager’s needs:

When the page is loaded the page presents my name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about me, my work, and how to contact me.

When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.

When viewing the section about my work then the section contains titled images of my applications.

When presented with the my first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others.

When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application.

When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport.
